Bank Customer Churn

To perform advanced analysis on customer churn using MySQL, you can write several SQL functions to help analyze customer behavior and predict churn based on the dataset you provided. Below are some SQL function examples and queries designed to gain deeper insights into churn patterns.

1- Data Cleaning and Preparation
1. The initial task is to clean and prepare the data before performing any advanced analysis using Excel.
2. Import Data into MySQL using Jupyter Notebooks and Pandas.
3. Handle Missing Values.


2- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with Advanced SQL Queries.
 calculate churn rate within segments without having to group the data manually. For example, calculate churn rate within different geographies, by age groups, or across gender.

3- Predictive Modeling in MySQL.
Classification with Decision Trees
While MySQL doesn’t natively support decision trees, I simulated a basic decision tree through nested CASE statements. This will give  a rule-based model for determining churn.

4- Creating Views for Simplified Data Analysis
A view is a virtual table representing the result of a stored query. It can be used to simplify complex queries, clean up data, or create meaningful data sets for further analysis.

5- Stored Procedures for Dynamic Queries and Analysis
Stored Procedures allow us to encapsulate complex SQL logic and reuse it easily. They also make it possible to execute dynamic queries and automate analysis processes.

5.2 Stored Procedure to Automatically Classify Customers Based on Churn Risk.

6- Triggers for Real-Time Data Monitoring
Triggers are used to automatically perform an action when an event occurs in a table, such as inserting or updating records. They are useful for updating derived columns, maintaining logs, or triggering alerts.

6.2 Trigger to Maintain Churn Log.


7- Functions for Advanced Data Manipulation.
to encapsulate logic that can be reused within queries, making the database operations more modular.

7.1 Customer Engagement Score Function.
This function calculates an engagement score for each customer based on the fluctuation of their account balance, the number of products they own, their credit card usage, and any complaints they’ve made. Customers with lower engagement scores are more likely to churn.

How It Works:
Balance: Customers with a higher balance are considered more engaged, as they’re more invested in their account. The score increases with the size of their balance.
NumOfProducts: Customers who own more products (like loans, insurance, etc.) are more engaged and loyal, so the score increases with the number of products they own.
Credit Card Usage: Credit card holders tend to have more active financial behavior. If a customer has a credit card, they receive a higher engagement score.
Complaint History: Customers with no complaints are considered more satisfied and engaged. Complaints reduce their engagement score.

8- Event in MySQL that periodically calculates and updates a table with customer engagement scores.
This is useful for keeping customer engagement data up-to-date without manually invoking the function.
